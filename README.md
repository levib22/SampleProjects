# SampleProjects

Hi! This is a repository containing some projects from my undergrad exeperience. Included are an implementation of 
AES (the Advanced Encryption Standard), a research presentation from a Intercultural & Technical Communications Class, 
and an implementation of a customizable shell similar to bash. I thought these to be the most relevant to my application as
it shows my experience studying Cryptography, using Linux & C, as well as my technical writitng skills.
